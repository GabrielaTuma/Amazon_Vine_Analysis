# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16 - Big Data

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members and non-members of the paid Amazon Vine program. 

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

SellBy stakeholders are looking for an analysis that will determine if there is any bias toward favourable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. In this particular analysis we are going to use reviews provided by Amazon AWS regarding **toys**:

#### Deliverable 1
- [x] 1. An Amazon Review dataset is extracted as a DataFrame
- [x] 2. The extracted dataset is transformed into four DataFrames with the correct columns
- [x] 3. All four DataFrames are loaded into their respective tables in pgAdmin

#### Deliverable 2
- [x] 1. There is a DataFrame or table for the vine_table data using one of three methods
- [x] 2. The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there are 20 or more total votes
- [x] 3. The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where the percentage of helpful_votes is equal to or greater than 50%
- [x] 4. The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there is a Vine review
- [x] 5. The data is filtered to create a DataFrame or table where there isn’t a Vine review
- [x] 6. The total number of reviews, the number of 5-star reviews, and the percentage 5-star reviews are calculated for all Vine and non-Vine reviews

#### Deliverable 3
- [x] 1. There is a title, and there are multiple sections
- [x] 2. Each section has a heading and subheading
- [x] 3. Links to images are working, and code is formatted and displayed correctly
- [x] 4. The purpose of this analysis is well defined
- [x] 5. There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews
- [x] 6. The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement
- [x] 7. An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement

## Results

For deliverable 1 four tables were created and loaded into postgres using Amazon's toy reviews dataset:

The last table was generated by filtering information about the vine program: the focus of deliverable 2 and 3.

Using PySpark and the Vine table created in the first deliverable it was possible to find the number of reviews from non-members compared to vine members. 

![votes](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/4f6e414f47ca5d35164c92e5ff262663e2ac9f00/Resources/Challenge%2016%20Images%20/useful_votes_count.png)

To improve accuracy a filter was applied to find useful data, only reviews with total_votes >= 20 and helpful_votes/total_votes > 50% were considered. 

![vine yes](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/4f6e414f47ca5d35164c92e5ff262663e2ac9f00/Resources/Challenge%2016%20Images%20/vine_yes.png)
![vine no](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/4f6e414f47ca5d35164c92e5ff262663e2ac9f00/Resources/Challenge%2016%20Images%20/vine_no.png)

We can see that the number of unpaid reviews is much larger, almost 98% of the reviews are not done through the Vine program.

![five star](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/4f6e414f47ca5d35164c92e5ff262663e2ac9f00/Resources/Challenge%2016%20Images%20/five_star_count.png)

It's hard to take a conclusion by looking at the absolute number of 5-star reviews once we already know that only about 2% of the votes come from Vine members. Having that in mind, the percentages of 5-star reviews compared to total reviews per category were calculated to test if Vine members tend to be more positive because the program is paid. 


![percentages](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/b311d2955b6a8644ce6760b5d639bfea5727756e/Resources/Challenge%2016%20Images%20/percentages.png)



The last two numbers calculated represent the percentage of 5-star reviews for each category individually. We can see that 5-star reviews represent around 34% of the vine dataframe and 48% of the unpaid dataframe. 

It’s clear that the percentage of vine 5-star reviews is lower (one third) compared to unpaid ones, almost half of the total, suggesting that there’s not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. If anything, Vine members are even more critical once the review is not something so casual. 


Only one category, toys, is being analyzed in this project. Even though the sample size is decent, with more than 60 thousand reviews, it’s important to state that the results might have a category bias. The same analysis should be done with different datasets (using the same code) to validate that vine reviews do not have a positivity bias. 

Also, using the same dataset,
